Hey there, new tenant.

So, as you can see, your new garage is locked up. I'm real sorry about that.
The previous tenant was a bit...eccentric. She was an engineer of some sorts, I think.
I understand that the garage is where she did all her work, and she liked to keep the place locked up.
Real tight, might I add.
Like, *real* real tight.
She installed this crazy locking mechanism, and neither me nor the intern can get it open.

You'll need a 4-digit code of some sort, clearly, but I'm afraid she didn't tell it to me before she moved out.
Can't get a hold of her to get the code either. Not sure what happened to the lady.

In any case, I had the intern try to "hack" the code.
If it helps, she's sure it *doesn't* start with a 0.
Said she tried everything from 0000 to 0999.
But then she said, "You don't even pay me for this" and quit.
I, ah, need to find a new intern.

However, before she quit she did find this weird...thingy...next to the garage door.
I attached it to this note.
Like I said, the prior tenant was an engineer of some sort, and I've got a hunch that thingy is the key to finding the code.
You just have to, uh, figure out how it works.
Sorry about that.

If it helps, I'll deduct the garage from your rent.
Since, well, you can't really use it.
Sorry about that.

Signed,

The Landlord
