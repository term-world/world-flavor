Welcome to your new home! I hope everything is to your liking.
There's just a couple things you'll need to take care of...

- [ ] Read this note
- [ ] Make a key
- [ ] Sign your lease

You'll need to make your own house key. Sorry about that.
It's the new rental intern's first week here. She's...learning.
I left our key-making kit in your bedroom.
Keep it. We've got dozens.

Once you've taken care of that, you'll need to sign your lease.
I left it in your home office.
We're, uh, pretty particular about how it's filled out.
So be sure to read the instructions on it. Carefully.

Once you're done with all that, just make note of it here, on this note.
I left some boxes for you to put an X in once each task is done.
They're at the top of this note. I'm sure you already saw them.
Just go ahead and write an X in that first box now that you've read this.
Be sure to delete the space, too. It's important. Trust me.

Welcome home.
                                        -The Landlord
