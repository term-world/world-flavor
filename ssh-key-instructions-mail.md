## SSH KEY CREATION INSTRUCTIONS

PLEASE FOLLOW THE BELOW INSTRUCTIONS NOW. YOU WILL NEED AN SSH KEY IN ORDER TO SECURELY STORE CHANGES YOU MAKE TO GITHUB.

1. WITHIN YOUR TERMINAL WINDOW (FILE LOCATION DOES NOT MATTER) COPY/PASTE THE COMMAND: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "YOUR ALLEGHENY EMAIL"` (REPLACE THE TEXT IN QUOTES WITH YOUR ALLEGHENY EMAIL ADDRESS)
2. WHEN ASKED FOR A LOCATION TO SAVE THE KEY, LEAVE IT BLANK TO ACCEPT THE DEFAULT VALUE AND PRESS ENTER
3. PROVIDE A PASSWORD FOR THE KEY -- NOTE THAT NO TEXT WILL APPEAR AS YOU TYPE (THIS IS A SECURITY FEATURE, NOT A BUG)
4. YOU WILL NEED TO ENTER THE PASSWORD A SECOND TIME FOR CONFIRMATION
5. WITHIN YOUR TERMINAL WINDOW (AGAIN, FILE LOCATION DOES NOT MATTER) COPY/PASTE THE COMMAND `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
6. YOU SHOULD SEE UTTER GIBBERISH; COPY THIS OUTPUT STARTING AT `ssh-rsa` AND ENDING AT YOUR ALLEGHENY EMAIL ADDRESS
7. IN A SEPARATE BROWSER TAB, NAVIGATE TO GITHUB
8. CLICK YOUR PROFILE PICTURE IN THE TOP RIGHT CORNER AND SELECT "SETTINGS"
9. LOCATE AND CLICK THE "SSH AND GPG KEYS" MENU ITEM
10. CLICK THE GREEN "NEW SSH KEY" BUTTON
11. TITLE YOUR KEY SOMETHING DESCRIPTIVE, LIKE "ALLEGHENY TERM-WORLD"
12. PASTE THE GIBBERISH FROM STEP 6 INTO THE "KEY FIELD"

YOU HAVE NOW CREATED YOUR SSH KEY AND ADDED IT TO GITHUB. CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU MIGHT CONSIDER MARKING THIS TASK AS COMPLETE ON YOUR TO-DO LIST.
