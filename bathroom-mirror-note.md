Hello again.

I used that key I mentioned to *make a change to the state of the world*.

I.e., I made this little note appear.

Cool, huh?

This key I mentioned...it's called an `SSH key`.

Try and keep up, but we're in a sort of *multiverse*.

Wild, right?

If you know how, you can make changes to slices of that multiverse--like the world we're in right now.

Once you make a *change to reality*, the `SSH key` will help make that change *stick*.

It'll help you *save* that change...to the `GitHub`.

The `GitHub` is even crazier than an `SSH key`.

It's this...place. A wild place. Where a whole bunch of different universes like ours are stored.

Like...a universe library, I guess. Incredible, right?

Each universe is saved inside of what is called a `repository` within `GitHub`.

A `repository` is basically a collection of all of the parts of a universe that make it *work*.

It can be...*changed*.

And each `repository` has a built-in history of all the ways in which different people have changed it.

You could be one of those people.

All you need is that `SSH key`. Think of it like an identifier. Like a signature.

The multiverse is a messy place, and to keep the chaos in check it helps to know *who* is doing *what* to it.

The `SSH key` does just that. It connects you to the `GitHub`. Securely.

You make an `SSH key` and even guys like me can't take it from you.

That's because there's two pieces to the `SSH key`.

The first piece is a `private key` that only you get.

The second piece is `public key` that works with the first piece to "complete" the connection.

Even if I have that second piece, I can't do diddly without that `private key`.

And that `private key` is stored safely inside of *you*. Er, *your machine*.

Speaking of...I used mine again. My `SSH key`, that is.

Go to your living room.

*You've got mail.*

Ciao,

TCTC
