Welcome to the neighborhood. I guess.

I bet you were expecting instructions on making a house key. Right?

From "The Landlord" or whatever. Yeah, no.

You won't be getting those instructions. Sorry.

Your house wasn't locked up. So, uh, I stole them.

The instructions, that is. Sorry, not sorry.

Also, I broke the key making kit. It's worthless now.

What can I say? I've got a destructive streak.

Probably why they thought you'd need a key.

But get this. I can get you an even *better* key.

One that'll let you mess with the very fabric of our reality.

Sounds cool, right?

It is. Cool, that is.

To prove how *cool* this key is, I just used it to mess with *your* reality.

Check your living room. *You've got mail.*

Ciao,

TCTC
